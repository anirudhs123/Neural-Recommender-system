# Neural-Reccomender-system

Built a whole pipeline of recommender systems comprising of Popularity based recommender, KNN similarity based Clustering recommender, Item-Item association based recommender, Bi-Partite graph based association recommender, Neural Graph based Collaborative Filtering and Neural Embedding based Collaborative filtering. These mdoels were built to work on three different datasets namely Amazon Book Dataset, Movie Lens Dataset and a Supermarket user-item interaction dataset.

## Key Contributions

1. The Neural Embedding based recommender was built for handling sparse input data. 
2. The Bi-Partite graph based association recommender was used for considering co-occurrences among items and to consider higher order proximities among the items.
3. Item-Item association recommender was built based on Apriori algorithm
