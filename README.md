# Neural-Reccomender-system

Built a whole pipeline of recommender systems comprising of Popularity  recommender, KNN based Clustering recommender, Item-Item association based recommender, Bi-Partite graph based association recommender, Neural Graph based Collaborative Filtering and Neural Embedding based recommender. The mdels have been used on three different datasets namely Amazon Book Dataset, Movie Lens Dataset and a supermarket user-item intercation dataset.


IndicSwipe demonstrates high decoding accuracies on both tasks varying from 70% to 95% across the 7 languages.

## Key Contributions

1. A Gesture Path Decoding model that uses a multi-headed Transformer along with LSTM layers for coordinate sequence encoding and a character-level LSTM model for character sequence decoding.
2. A Contrastive Transliteration correction model that uses position-aware character embeddings to measure word proximities and correct spellings of transliterated words.
3. Two datasets of simulated word traces for supporting work on gesture typing for Indic language keyboards including low resource languages like Telugu and Kannada.
4. The accuracies of the proposed models vary from 70 to 89% for English-to-Indic decoding and 86-95% for Indic-to-Indic decoding across the 7 languages used for the study.
